## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper interfaces for data structures
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component and variable names

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic (#0A84FF theme)
- Ensure responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Keep glow effects and animations consistent

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `TaskList`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleTaskComplete`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `task-list.tsx`)

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting a PR:
- [ ] Test on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Test real-time sync functionality
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check that animations work smoothly

## 🎨 Design Principles

When adding features, keep these in mind:
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Neon blue (#0A84FF), glowing effects, grid patterns
- **Performance**: Smooth animations, no lag
- **Responsiveness**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive UI
- **Gamification**: Make progress tracking fun and engaging

## 📦 Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```

```
